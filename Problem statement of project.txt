Problem Definition:  
Enquiry Management System (EMS) is an online system to handle daily students' Enquiry for listed courses.   
Nowadays EMS is a common need of an institution that would like to handle daily Enquiries of students, about the courses offered.  
So that later on they can plan to send SMS, Email and do the proper follow-ups.  
 
Here we want you to develop an Enquiry Handling module, which will track daily Enquiry handled by authenticating the user.  
This module should allow one login entry point, where all users can log in, and after that Enquiry, handling form will be displayed, 
where users can enter Enquiry information, and just below that total enquiry should be displayed in tabular format.     

Business Requirement:
1. System should have a User as well as Student Enquiry support user wise.  
2. There should not be pre-filled data in tables.  
3. System should have support for options like: 
		a. User Login  
		b. User Registration  
		c. Add Enquiry  
		d. Edit Enquiry  
		e. Delete Enquiry  
		f.  Show todayâ€™s Enquiry  
		g. Searching by name  
4. You need to create proper tables with proper names and have a proper relationship  
5. Design the flow of the application and send it along with the source code.
